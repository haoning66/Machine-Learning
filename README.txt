Hi, this is README.

Environment: Mac OS 10.13.6  python3.6 

This is an implement for two machine learning algorithm. The file decision_tree.py is for decision tree algorithm, the file nn.py is for neural network. The other files is the dataset files. To run the file just use command "python3 decision_tree.py" and you can get the result. Remember, the dataset files should be in the same folder with these two python files. 

NOTICE!: I use external library tensorflow and pandas. To run the code, make sure your pyhton3 has these libraries.
